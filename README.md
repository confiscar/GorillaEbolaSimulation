# Ebola Simulation among population of Gorillas

## Getting Started 

These instructions will help you get a copy of this repository running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Although still not implemented, I'm planning on just linking the .jar in a link if you just want to run it. 

### Prerequisites

The program was developed using **Mason** and **Java SDK 11**. The Mason library and supporting libraries can be obtained from [here](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/). 
This program uses [picocli](https://github.com/remkop/picocli) to parse the shell parameters. Picocli is included in the program files, meaning no additional installation is needed. 

### Installing

Once the project is cloned and imported into your IDE, just point the project library settings towards the libraries you downloaded above. 

(In IntelliJ, you'd go into **Project Structure**->**Libraries** and then press the '**+**' button.  Point it towards the .jar files you downloaded.)

Then you can simply run the main function in the ApesWithUI class to start the simulation console. Alternatively, the program can be used in a CLI. Running the program with the ```--help``` tag. 

## Running 

This header will be updated as the development process continues.

As a placeholder, 2 windows should open when you run the program. One of them will be the console, with a set of controls to pause and play the simulation. The other will be the display frame for the visualization of the simulation. Pressing '▶' should run and display the visualization in the display frame.
